## Game Lore (Actually good lore pls read ðŸ˜­)
The founder of hack club, Zach, caught you faking your tickets (How could you man?!?)! And now he's locked you up in Arcade prison. Is that legal? Idk, I just write lore. But you wanna break out right? Wait-- you don't? Just play along its part of the script I need to read to fill my quota ok. You wanna break out right? Exactly! Don't worry, the Arcade staff are busy getting Hakkuun to wake up so you have 10 minutes to escape! Steal keys, knock out (in a peaceful and safe manner, of course haha) the guards, and break out! What are you waiting for? Oh wait I haven't finished the game yet. Oops.

Although after all that I think I'd rather you stay in prison lol. Also isn't it ironic that I'm submitting a game, about how someone faked tickets as lore, to get tickets myself? Hi reviewers!

## How to play

This game is a puzzle/timed sort of game I guess. 

Your goal (if you didn't read the lore) is to escape! Do so by entering new sections of the map, getting keys, completing a minigame, etc. I'm trying not to spoil too much ok. Your goal is to figure out how this prison works. You can walk back to previous rooms, this isn't a typical 1-way level style game. It really is a maze!


## Tips (And small spoilers)
- Hack club is cheap, like really cheap (the budget went to the framework 16's and iPads ok), they only hired guards who are LITERALLY BLIND. Their view distance is only a 1-block radius. So even if they look DIRECTLY AT YOU, you'll be good unless you're literally in front of their face. 

- Doors are colour coded (I.e yellow key opens yellow door)

- Guards go in predictable patterns, so take your time watching them

- You can try again! Hitting a laser (or getting caught in any other way) will take 30 seconds off the time limit, but you aren't completely screwed!

## Movement keys
- WASD = movement
- L = start/restart game as directed by screen prompts
- I = set the pins on the lockpick minigame

## Issues

I tested this game as much as I could! And I certainly hope there are no bugs! But ~~if~~ **when** I'm wrong, create a Github issue and I'll notice eventually!


## Credit where its due

The following sources were used. All code used from other sources was modified to sort my use case.
- Timer mechanics & concept: https://sprig.hackclub.com/~/pIrXiIjFINorvL2bCYM9
- The back-and-forth infinite loopy thingy: ChatGPT was prompted to create a script to iterate through an array back and fourth forever, I took the function, modified it, and used it to make the guard go back and forth
