Sprig Maze Game lol

## Game Lore (Actually good lore pls read ðŸ˜­)
The founder of hack club, Zach, caught you faking your tickets (How could you man?!?)! And now he's locked you up in Arcade prison. Is that legal? Idk, I just write lore. But you wanna break out right? Wait-- you don't? Just play along its part of the script I need to read to fill my quota ok. You wanna break out right? Exactly! Don't worry, the Arcade staff are busy getting Hakkuun to wake up so you have 10 minutes to escape! Steal keys, knock out (in a peaceful and safe manner, of course haha) the guards, and break out! What are you waiting for? Oh wait I haven't finished the game yet. Oops.

Although after all that I think I'd rather you stay in prison lol. Also isn't it ironic that I'm submitting a game, about how someone faked tickets as lore, to get tickets myself? Hi reviewers!

## How to play

This game is a puzzle/timed sort of game I guess. 

Your goal (if you didn't read the lore) is to escape! Do so by unlocking new sections of the map, gettings keys, completing minigames, etc. I'm trying not to spoil too much ok.
